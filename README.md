## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

on this project, I learned several things such as:

- using javascript to call success state
- forming the correct logic in using semantic elements such as section or article
- familiarize myself with mobile first workflow and fix the logic in styling such as when to width 100%, where to use the right flex, and also give a sweet touch especially on buttons to smooth the user experience
